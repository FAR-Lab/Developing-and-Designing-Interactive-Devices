Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Functional check-off - May 10
 
Final Project Presentations (video watch party) - May 12

 

Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing. 

Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)


Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
