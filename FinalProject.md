# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 15

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 17

Functional check-off - November 29 & December 1

Final Project Presentations - December 6

Write-up and documentation due - December 12

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing, and test the interaction with people. 

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.
.

## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
