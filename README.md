## Office Hours 

The main time to talk to the teaching team about your labs or projects are during the Wednesday labs. 

Outside of that time, the teaching team is generally available on Slack, and usually respond within hours during their working day, and by the next working day otherwise. 

We will set up office hours if more structured support appears to be needed.
