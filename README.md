## Student Submissions:

Fork  [the Interactive Lab Page repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Interactive-Lab-Hub), and then put a link for your Lab Hub to the list below. Detailed instructions for creating your lab hub and updating your labs are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).

When submitting your assignments, you will update your assignments on your class lab hub. The teaching team will be review the assignments sometime after the due date. Late assignments (e.g. your assignment is missing/incomplete at our grading time, which is after the due date) will be penalized by one letter grade per day late.

## Office Hours 

The main time to talk to the teaching team about your labs or projects are during the Thursday labs. 

Outside of that time, the teaching team is generally available on Slack, and usually respond within hours during their working day, and by the next working day otherwise. 

We will set up office hours if more structured support appears to be needed.
