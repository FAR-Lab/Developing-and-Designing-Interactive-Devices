## Student Submissions:

Fork  [the Interactive Lab Page repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Interactive-Lab-Hub); detailed instructions for creating your lab hub and updating your labs are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2023Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).

When submitting your assignments, you will update your assignments on your own class lab hub, and post a link to your Github page on Canvas. Graders will review the assignments after the due date. Late assignments (e.g. your assignment is missing/incomplete at our grading time, which is after the due date) will be penalized by one letter grade per day late.



## Office Hours 

The main time to talk to the teaching team about your labs or projects are during the Thursday labs. 

Outside of that time, Professor Ju is generally available on Slack, and usually respond within hours during their working day, and by the next working day otherwise. 

The TAs office hours will be on Fridays.
